# TOIF-Adaptor
Adaptor for TOIF and PMD
The Tool Output Integration Framework (TOIF) is a powerful composite vulnerability detection platform.
This tools combines different vulnerabilty analysis tools and outputs the result.
Adaptor for PMD is not present, I tried to create adaptor for PMD so that it can be used along with TOIF.
